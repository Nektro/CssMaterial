CssMaterial is a project with the aim of producing a working implementation of Material Design by Google
all while using as little Javascript as possible in a library format so only the styles you use get applied.

This is a WIP project so all features outlined in the spec may not be available.

## Material Design
Material Design is a layout and design philosophy made by Google originally for the Android project. Since
then millions of apps and websites have adapted that philosophy. This is an attempt to recreate some of those
components and features with as little Javascript as possible. See the whole spec [here](https://www.google.com/design/spec/).
