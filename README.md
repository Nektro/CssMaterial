# CssMaterial
CssMaterial is a project with the aim of producing a working implementation of Material Design by Google
all while using as little Javascript as possible.

All features were designed as a library so you only style what you add the appropriate classes to!

This is a WIP project so all features outlined in the spec may not be available.
